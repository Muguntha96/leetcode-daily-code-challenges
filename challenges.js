// Exercise:1 You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
// Example 1:Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb" Output: 3
// Example 2:Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ" Output: 0
